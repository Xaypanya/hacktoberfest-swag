# Hacktoberfest 2024 Swag List

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Hacktoberfest is digitalocean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout october. Much of modern tech infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of digitalocean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

## Adding a swag to the list

Found a swag opportunity we don't have yet? You can easily add it using the
following steps:

1. Go to the swag list JSON file:
   https://github.com/swapnilsparsh/hacktoberfest-swag/blob/master/src/data/data-2024.json

2. Look for the organization which is giving this swag: For
   example let's take **HACKTOBERFEST** as an example, we will open the
   corresponding array and add an object to it as follows:

```
 [
  {
    "org": "https://www.digitalocean.com/",
    "text": "Hacktoberfest",
    "description": "4 pull requests in any eligible repository.",
    "swags": "Tree",
    "href": "https://hacktoberfest.com/"
  }
]
```

3. Once done you can now raise a Pull Request to the main branch and Vercel
   will create a preview of your PR and then will be merged accordingly.Never
   delete or change any existing swag listings from the JSON file. <br>
